# Machine Learning Foundations

Covers core concepts used in Machine Learning. We will see how these concepts get used by different ML algorithms.

This serves 2 purposes:
1. This sets us on a strong footing to start implementing ML algos ourselves.
2. Equips us to start using ML toolkits.

We will do both (1) and (2) in the rest of the course.

Date: TBD
